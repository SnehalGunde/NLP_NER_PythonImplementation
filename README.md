Named Entity Recognition (NER) enables you to easily identify the key elements in a piece of text, such as a person’s name, locations, brands, monetary values, dates and so on. 
 
Some example sentences with their named-entity recognition are as follows:
 
Note that GPE is short for the geopolitical entity, ORG is short for organisation and PER is short for a person.
 
#### S: ‘Why is Australia burning?’
- NER:   ‘Why is Australia[GPE] burning?’

#### S: ‘UK exits EU’
- NER:  ‘UK[GPE] exits EU[ORG]’
